# PythonPacManGame
This is old man..., this was the thrid thing that i made when i was learning programming, it was on June of 2020 and now i decided to show it to the world!!!

Some fun-facts that you din't wanted but you'll read:

* The code and logic is a mess, but it's a miracle that it works!!

* For moving, use WASD and hit ENTER for any other thing (like entering or going out of the menus)

* The game took me two months of developing : D

Anyways..., here is a screenshot of the game:

The game was made with Python 3.8.2 and requires Pygame 1.9.6

If you don't have Python installed:
  You can get it very easy, here's the official site: https://www.python.org/

If you don't have Pygame installed:
  You can install it with pip install pygame (if you already have Python and Pip)
    
THE GAME DOESN'T HAVE ANY DOCUMENTATION !!!
